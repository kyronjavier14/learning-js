Hello!

My name is Kyle, and this repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I learn the **JavaScript** programming language.

## About This Repo

While I have coded in JavaScript before, I’ve never taken the time to really dive deep into the language and master its concepts. This repo will serve as a personal log to track my learning journey, document what I’ve learned, and track challenges I’ve faced along the way.

## Resources

I’ll be using the following resources to guide my learning:

1. **[Roadmap.sh - JavaScript](https://roadmap.sh/javascript)**
   A comprehensive roadmap that shows the key concepts and technologies related to JavaScript, from beginner to advanced.

2. **[FreeCodeCamp - Full JavaScript Course for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/full-javascript-course-for-beginners/)**
   A full beginner-friendly course that covers JavaScript fundamentals and more advanced topics.

3. **[MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**
   The official Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation for JavaScript. It’s an excellent resource for in-depth references and explanations.

## Learning Goals

I don’t have a fixed goal for each day but aim to consistently learn something new every day. Whether it's mastering a basic concept, learning a new method, or exploring an advanced feature, I’ll make sure to keep pushing forward.

### Progress Tracking

* **Daily updates**: I will try to update the repo with my progress, learnings, and challenges faced.
* **Challenges**: I will also include any small challenges or exercises I complete along the way to reinforce the concepts.

## Motivation

JavaScript is a powerful, versatile language, and I’m excited to deepen my understanding. The journey won’t always be linear, but consistency will help me level up my skills, and I’ll be sure to celebrate small wins!
